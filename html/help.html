			<h2>Filters</h2>
			<ul id="filters_top">
				<li>
					A filter consists of two items, a columnID and a regex. To set a filter, use: columnID:regex <br />
				</li>
				<li>
					ColumnIDs are NOT the column headers; they actually identify the XML tag whose contents the regex will test. However, naming conventions
					should remain consistent between the headers and ids. There are also a few hidden IDs that can be used as well:
					<ul class="filters_inner">
						<li>start &gt;&gt; start time of task </li>
						<li>finish &gt;&gt; finish time of task (Only applies to the "done" qtasks tab) </li>
						<li>ss_taken &gt;&gt; timestamp of snapshot that captured this task </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Regex is short for <b>Reg</b>ular <b>Ex</b>pression. A regular expression is basically a way of describing text with a pattern.
					More precisely, a regex is a sequence of characters defining a pattern. This pattern describes a set of strings that it 'accepts'.
					For the regex to accept a string, the string must contain the regex. We say that a string 'matches' a regex if the regex accepts it.
					There's a lot of mathematical theory behind regexes, but you don't need to know any of it to use them. Here's some examples of regexes:
					<ul class="filters_inner">
						<li>abc &gt;&gt; matches abc</li>
						<li>[a-zA-Z0-9] &gt;&gt; matches any alphanumeric character</li>
						<li>[^L] &gt;&gt; matches any string with no L</li>
						<li>^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$ &gt;&gt; matches (Most) valid email addresses</li>
					</ul>
					Word of caution: Regexes are powerful, but not omnipotent. Be careful how and when you use them, as it can be very easy to break everything
					with a ill-defined pattern. That being said, here are some resources for learning how to create and use regexes:
					<ul class="filters_inner">
						<li><a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html" target="_newtab">Regular Expressions Quickstart</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.regexr.com" target="_newtab">Regex Tester</a> (Anything from this should also work as a filter)</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.rexegg.com" target="_newtab">Advanced Regular Expressions</a></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Sample Filters:
					<ul class="filters_inner">
						<li>user:zshore &gt;&gt; matches all tasks submitted by user zshore</li>
						<li>elapsed:\d[1,2](:\d\d){2}$ &gt;&gt; matches any task that had an elapsed time of 1-3 hours </li>
						<li>submit:10-02 2[0-3](:\d\d){2}$ &gt;&gt; matches any task submitted on Oct. 02 between 8-11:59 pm</li>
						<li>user:zshore~,task:fx~,elapsed:\d[1-4](:\d\d)$ &gt;&gt; matches any task submitted by zshore, with fx in the task name, with an elapsed time of 1-5 minutes</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
